# Overview

I chose to create this program to start learning more about Typescript, and how it allows for deeper functionality with webpages.

This program should be a basis for creating a login/authentication functionality for webpages. Allowing for the input of a username and password along with some basic information about the user.

I have no experience with HTML, Typscript/Javascript, or CSS starting this project. So I felt that it would be fun to just see how far I could get. Using various tutorials, demos, and ChatGPT to help create a base that I can build off of and hopefully understand more of what developing a webpage involves.

Below is the demo video link, as of right now YouTube is not working for me but I shall update the link when I get that figured out.

# Development Environment

I chose to use Visual Studio Code as my editor, along with various tools such as node.js and python to simulate servers and allow for testing of the website.

I have found HTML, Typescript and CSS very confusing persoanlly. It took a bit of getting used to with the different tags, and how each file interacts and can link together. But overall I like the functionality they can show. Alowing for a very broad range of functinality within a very small amount of code.

# Useful Websites

I focused the most on these couple websites:

- [W3schools](https://www.w3schools.com)
- [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/learn/asynchronous-work/overview-of-blocking-vs-non-blocking)

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}

- Database management to keep track of user data. Right now it just disapears.
- Better design, CSS and HTML can make the webpage look much better.
- Encryption to protect user data.
